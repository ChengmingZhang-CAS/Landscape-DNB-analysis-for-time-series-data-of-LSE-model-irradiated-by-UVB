# Landscape-DNB-analysis-for-time-series-data-of-LSE-model-irradiated-by-UVB
Codes of "Landscape dynamic network biomarker analysis reveals the tipping point of transcriptome reprogramming to prevent skin photodamage". This work on the basis of wet LSE model and dry l-DNB model identified the tipping point of the skin lightning during UVB irradiation with the core DNB genes, which not only accurately predicted the skin lightning but also effectively prognose clinical trial. The results provide new insights into molecular mechanism of skin response to UVB and novel network biomarkers for skin protection.
